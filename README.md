## 🔄 Git Workflow


### Before you start working
```bash
git pull
```
Or in GitHub Desktop: Click "Fetch origin" then "Pull origin"


### Adding your work
1. Save your files in the correct folder
2. In GitHub Desktop, you'll see your changes listed
3. Write a short commit message describing what you added (e.g., "Add Rahul character portraits")
4. Click "Commit to main"
5. Click "Push origin"


### Asset Guidelines
- **Export final files only** — avoid committing WIP or source files (.psd, .blend)
- **Use lowercase with dashes** for filenames: `rahul-happy.png`, `backpack-grid.png`
- **Keep file sizes smol** — compress PNGs, export FBX without embedded textures
